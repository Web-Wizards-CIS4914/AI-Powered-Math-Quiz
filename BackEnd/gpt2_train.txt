Explain what a logarithm is in algebra.
A logarithm is the inverse of exponentiation. It tells you the power to which a base number must be raised to produce a given number.

Solve for x in the equation 2x + 5 = 15.
First, subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 10. Then, divide both sides by 2 to get x = 5.

What is a complex number?
A complex number is a number that has both a real part and an imaginary part. It can be written in the form a + bi, where "a" is the real part and "b" is the imaginary part.

Explain how to simplify the expression (5 - 6i)(-10 - 7i).
To simplify, multiply each term in the first complex number by each term in the second, then combine like terms. Don’t forget that i^2 = -1.

Choose the smallest set of Real numbers that √-1980 belongs to.
Since the square root of a negative number is not real, √-1980 belongs to the set of Complex numbers.

How do you find the conjugate of a complex number?
To find the conjugate of a complex number a + bi, you change the sign of the imaginary part, resulting in a - bi.

Explain what i^2 is.
In complex numbers, i^2 is equal to -1. This is a key property of imaginary numbers.

Solve the equation 3x - 9 = 12.
First, add 9 to both sides to get 3x = 21. Then divide both sides by 3 to find x = 7.

Explain the Order of Operations.
The order of operations tells you to do calculations in the following order: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right). Remember it with PEMDAS.

What is the smallest set of Real numbers that the number -√57600 / 144 belongs to?
Since -√57600 is -240, which is an integer, the answer is "Integer."

How do you solve for x in the equation 5x + 3 = 28?
Subtract 3 from both sides to get 5x = 25, then divide both sides by 5 to get x = 5.

What are rational numbers?
Rational numbers are numbers that can be written as a fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.
